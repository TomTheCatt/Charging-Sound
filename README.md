# Charging Sound
Set a sound when your charging cord is plugged in or removed.

If you want to see the source code of Charging-Sound, please see [this link](https://github.com/TomTheCatt/Charging-Sound-Source). The original program was coded using Python 3, and packaged using PyInstaller. Please follow the "Install" instructions below to properly install the program onto your computer. More instructions can be found below to solve other issues. If a problem persists, please report it. I would be happy to solve it.

## Install

### Step 1
Download the file through Github. Python 3 is not needed.

### Step 2
Double-click "install.exe" in `Apps > install.exe`. Accept all permissions it asks for until none are asked.

## Changing Sounds
By default, all sounds are Half-Life 2 healing sound effects. However, you can easily change this to be whatever you want!

### Step 1
Find and download a sound file and change the format to `.wav`.

### Step 2
Bring file to the same directory with `main.exe`, `install.exe`, and `uninstall.exe`.

If you want the sound to be played when you plug in your computer, delete `charging_sound.wav` and rename your new file(and it's extension) to `charging_sound.wav`.

If you want the sound to be played when you disconnect the charger from your computer, delete `not_charging_sound.wav` and rename your new file(and it's extension) to `not_charging_sound.wav`.

Having only one sound file will cause an error in the program, so if you want nothing to be played, you can uninstall the program or set one sound file to silence and one to your desired sound.

## Uninstall
If you are wanting to remove the program for any reason, please make sure to delete it correctly!

### Step 1
Double-click "uninstall.exe" in `Apps > uninstall.exe` and accept all permissions it asks for until none are asked.

### Step 2
Select the file containing the entire program and delete it.

## Re-installing
Perhapse something went wrong or you moved the file, you should re-install the program to get it working porperly.

### Step 1
Double-click "uninstall.exe" in `Apps > uninstall.exe`. Accept all permissions until none are asked.

### Step 2
Double-click "install.exe" in `Apps > install.exe`. Accept all permissions until none are asked.
